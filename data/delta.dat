c


rank/order of the interfacial drag coefficient tensor

general guidlines:

s for spheres: we use the same expression for delta, for both/all directions (preferably for the problem
where we have neumann/dirichlet conditions at the bottom of the domain.

c for cylinders: we use two different expressions of delta to express the non-isotropic nature of the porous 
medium we are considering (rods/forest)
